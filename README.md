I worked on the Udacity data engineering nanodegree projects during the beginning of 2020. I completed projects that are broken up into folders in this repo. These helped me improve skills in AWS (S3 & Redshift), Airflow, database concepts, `boto3` python package, PySpark and more. 

Each project has a README that specifies its purpose.

This code is not meant to be run as I simply removed my configuration file that specifies my AWS secret access key and access key.
